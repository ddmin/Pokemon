# Pokemon
A Pokemon class in addition to a Pokemon database created with the help from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

**Note: PokeAPI only supports Pokemon up to Pokemon Sun and Moon at the moment.**


Example of Pokedex:

```python
pikachu = Pokemon("Pikachu", 5, ability="Static", moves=['thunderbolt', 'surf', 'quick-attack', 'thunder'])
print(pikachu.pokedex())
```
